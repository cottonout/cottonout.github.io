                        <h3>Big Bang</h3>
                        <p>
                            After cosmic inflation stopped, energy transferred to matter and light, causing the universe to expand exponentially, much faster than the speed of light, for a brief period of time. During that period of time, the universe's earliest elements, Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium and Beryllium soon came to creation. Soon after, the universe had cooled enough and expanded at a much slower and gradual rate.

                        <h3>Cosmic Inflation</h3>
                        <p>
                            13.8 billion years ago, the universe expanded from an extremely small, extremely hot and extremely dense state faster than the speed of light for a fraction of a second. It has expanded since then and become less dense and cooler. The expansion of the universe actually refers to the increase in the space between galaxies.

                        <h3>What lies for the future?</h3>
                        <p>For many years, scientists thought the universe's current expansion was slowing down. But in fact, cosmic expansion is speeding up. In 1998, astronomers found that certain supernovae, bright stellar explosions, were fainter than expected. They concluded this could only happen if the supernovae had moved farther away, at a faster rate than predicted. Scientists suspect a mysterious substance they call dark energy is accelerating expansion. Future research may yield new surprises, but cosmologists suggest it's likely the universe will continue to expand forever.</p>

                        <p>
                            Gas was not uniformly distributed throughout the universe. Cooler areas of space were lumpier, with denser clouds of gas. As these clumps grew more massive, their gravity attracted additional matter. As they became denser, and more compact, the centers of these clumps became hotter - hot enough that nuclear fusion occurred in their centers. These were the first stars. They were 30 to 300 times more massive than our Sun and millions of times brighter. Over several hundred million years, the first stars collected into the first galaxies.

                        <p>
                            After the formation of the very first atoms, the universe became opaque at shorter wavelengths due to the absorbing effects of all the hydrogen atoms. For the next 200 million years, the universe remained dark. There were no stars to shine. At this point, the universe consisted of a sea of hydrogen atoms, helium and traces of heavier elements.

                        <h2>What happens if you fall inside a black hole?</h2>
                        <p>You go through "spaghettification". Your body will violently contort and explode due to the contrasting different gravitational forces. Its gravity would exert a much stronger pull on your feet than your head, stretching you out along the direction of travel and turning you into a noodle.</p>

                        <p>It's impossible to fall inside a white hole. White holes act as anit-black holes, in which they repel all matter and light.</p>

                        <p>Due to the unstable nature of worm holes, you would most likely go through "spaghettification", and come out as radiation on the other side of the worm hole. Worm holes are very prone to collapsing quickly, before the person could even travel any significant distance.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, no. Universes are far beyond the observable horizon of space, and move away much faster than the speed of light. It would be impossible no matter what to travel to another universe.</p>

                        <p>While the Big Freeze seems like the most likely possibility for the fate of the universe, other scientists have theorised the Big Crunch Theory. It refers to the universe's expansion eventually reversing and collapsing in on itself, possibly leading to a singularity similar to the Big Bang, though the opposite of it.</p>
